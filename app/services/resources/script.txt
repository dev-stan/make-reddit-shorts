I have been seeing lots of post with people voicing their pain and disappointment with solo travel, to which I understand. I think a torrent of nostalgia and rosey coloured stories-coupled with some well shot social media post has made the idea of solo traveling into this escapest fantasy where you will find forever friends, the one or some sort of long cherished memory. Some of these true, but often times not.

I think people should have a tamer perspective on solo traveling, learn to love and enjoy their own company before thrusting themselves into the wild and facing massive disappointments.
