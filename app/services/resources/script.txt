About two months ago, I was booked on a flight to Germany to fix a server system, being the only one familiar with the ancient tech involved. Flights/hotels etc all booked. Nice n' swanky.  
Suddenly get a ticket from "the powers that be": "very important job - drop everything for this". HR has cancelled my flight, and the hotel (no refunds apparently - so money wasted).  
What was the issue you ask? Was a server on fire? Had the CEOs second mistress found out about the other three and he needed his browsing history securely deleted?  
Nope - the COO's secretary had bitched about her keyboard "not working" had emailed the board of directors stating she had critical work that would bring down the entire company if not completed (or words to that effect).  
Off I race down the motorway. I get to the building. She's not there. Apparently she raised the issue then f--cked off on holiday for two weeks........  
And what was the problem with the keyboard? It wasn't plugged into the USB port........  
Edit: the tech stuff is re-scheduled to be sorted, the lady in question received no punishment at all. not even a wrist slap. I suspect she 'knows stuff' about the higher ups......
