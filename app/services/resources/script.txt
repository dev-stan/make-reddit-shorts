I'm looking to solo travel Europe over summer (June-September).

I went to France in June last year and it was SO BUSY. Every time I got on public transport (I mean IF there was room for me to get on) I was cramped like a little sardine between a bunch of sweaty tourists and angry French people. I don't want to imagine what it'd be like in more popular months such as July and August.

I'm guessing it's like this in most popular European cities (Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Amsterdam etc.)?

Is there anywhere that may be a little calmer over summer, or is everywhere going to be crazy?
