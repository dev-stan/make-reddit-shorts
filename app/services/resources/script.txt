First off, I'm not tech support but I figured this fits here.  
About me: I (M 36) am a security guard on a data centre at weekends to pay for my Cybersecurity degree I am just wrapping up. It was staff at this data centre that actually pushed me to university as I was asking a lot of questions.  
Today, I come into work at 7am and have a quick handover from the night guards (M 30's). He tells me he accidentally turned the PC off instead of locking the screen before his patrol in the night.  
The computer, being on a data centre, has high level of security than a normal office and is encrypted with bitlocker. The night guard tells me he has not managed to get past the encryption to log back in. With him being a new guard on this site, I assumed he just didn't know how to use the yubikey correctly so I start to show him how to use it.  
I go to plug it in to the computer and it is switched off. I turn it on and was surprised when he asked what that button was for?  
I can not fathom how a young bloke in his 30's does not know how to even turn on a computer. The schools here, as in many countries, have classes dedicated to using computers and have since before I was in school, around the same time as him, and he never even picked up what a power switch is for.  
4 hours he had no computer, and in turn, no cctv because he didn't know he needed to turn on the computer to log in.
