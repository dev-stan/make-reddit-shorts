I've been flying my whole life(since i was a month old). I estimate i have probably been on around 70 planes or so, and flying was never a problem for me until recently, because in the last 5 flights I have had terrible anxiety when on the plane. I know how unlikely crashes are and somewhat understand how planes work, but I still have fear when normal stuff such as turbulence occurs. Can anyone give me tips to overcome this problem?
